### Information
Sanguine is a project that I've been working on for a long time. The Hypixel Zombies community is quite small, and because of that there is little mod support for it. I come from playing Skyblock, which has a ridiculous amount of mods and enhancements, and my goal is to bring that to Zombies aswell.

Sanguine takes Hypixel Zombies' limited mods and introduces a multitude of QOL and render features to improve your Zombies experience. (Note, all features are designed to still count as legitimate. This mod should NOT be bannable).

**Sanguine is currently IN DEVELOPMENT!**
